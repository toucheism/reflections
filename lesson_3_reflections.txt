When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I would want to use a remote repository in the event that multiple people are working on a 
  project or perhaps if I jump around on different devices to do work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I would always want to pull changes manually, becuase it gives me control of what gets pulled and wouldn't compromise files that have changed locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are useful when you just want a copy of a work in progress but not to disturb the process by making changes to the master code. 
	Clones are copies of repositories that get stored locally.
	Branches are different commit points that deviate from the Head in persuite of experimenting or collaborating on a single project.
