When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I would want to use a remote repository in the event that multiple people are working on a 
  project or perhaps if I jump around on different devices to do work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I would always want to pull changes manually, becuase it gives me control of what gets pulled and wouldn't compromise files that have changed locally.
